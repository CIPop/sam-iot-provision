# Chain of Trust Storage

Any file located in this folder will be used to override the corresponding Chain of Trust file that is auto-generated by the provisioning tool.
If this folder does not contain any chain of trust files, then the provisioning tool will use all the default mock files that are auto-generated.

The following file names for each Chain of Trust component must be used:

- Root Certificate = `root-ca.crt`
- Root Key = `root-ca.key`
- Signer Certificate = `signer-ca.crt`
- Signer Certificate Signing Request (CSR) = `signer-ca.csr`
- Signer Key = `signer-ca.key`
