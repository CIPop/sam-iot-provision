# Certificates and Keys

When the provisioning process has completed, this folder will contain the certificates and keys which were generated and used during provisioning of the SAM-IoT WG development board.

# Generating a Verification Certificate (Microsoft Azure)

1. Open a Git Bash window (Start menu &gt; type “Git Bash”)

2. Generate a certification signing request (CSR) by entering the below command. A CSR is generated by encrypting these two key inputs:

    - The `root-ca.key` generated in previous step by Microchip IoT Provisioning tool. This will be used in the openssl command line below.
    - The `Verification Code` generated by the Azure portal. You will be asked to provide this during the process of creating the CSR.

    **Note**: Once you enter to command below, you will be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. Enter the verification code (generated from the Azure portal) when prompted for the `Common Name`. For the rest of the fields, you can enter anything you want...

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -key root-ca.key -out azure_root_ca_verification.csr
    ```

    As a result, the file `azure_root_ca_verification.csr` is created

3. Generate a verification certificate by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -in azure_root_ca_verification.csr -CA root-ca.crt -CAkey root-ca.key -CAcreateserial -out azure_signer_verification.cer -days 365 -sha256
    ```

    As a result, the file `azure_signer_verification.cer` is created
